Extending the Project
You've done all the required steps, but if you'd like to make this project your own, here are some ideas:

Add sorting and filtering options to the browse command
Add pagination to the browse command
Add concurrency to the agg command so that it can fetch more frequently
Add a search command that allows for fuzzy searching of posts
Add bookmarking or liking posts
Add a TUI that allows you to select a post in the terminal and view it in a more readable format (either in the terminal or open in a browser)
Add an HTTP API (and authentication/authorization) that allows other users to interact with the service remotely
Write a service manager that keeps the agg command running in the background and restarts it if it crashes
